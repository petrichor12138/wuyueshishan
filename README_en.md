# About This Repository
This repository is established based on my personal WeChat public account "Wuyue Shishan" (literally "Covering the Moon and Picking up Mountains"). It mainly stores my travel notes, essays, and other articles, and may also include some photos and videos.

If you're interested in these contents, you're welcome to follow my WeChat public account "Wuyue Shishan". You can also contact me via email at <petrichor12138@163.com>.

The name of this repository "Wuyue Shishan" is actually a homophone for "May 13th" in Chinese, because May 13th is my birthday. However, this date was already taken and couldn't be registered as a WeChat public account name. After much thought, I came up with this poetic homophone.

Also, the public account avatar was generated by AI. It looks somewhat antique, but that's because I lack artistic talent and couldn't draw a nice avatar myself. If there's an opportunity in the future, I might update this avatar.

# Some Thoughts
The reason for creating this public account and GitHub repository is that I always feel I should write something - to record my thoughts in some way, so that even when the physical body is gone, the soul may remain eternal.
